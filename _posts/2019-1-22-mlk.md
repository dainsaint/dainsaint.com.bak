last night was mlk<br/>
last night i had a dream<br/>
this morning was a nightmare<br/>
that my dream was yet unseen<br/>
i hear voices in my heart<br/>
i dont know what they mean<br/>
but i understand the truth<br/>
yes i understand the scene<br/>

yes i understand the amazon<br/>
understand that Amazon<br/>
understand the ancient days of planning in advance are gone<br/>
understand the bassline in the back of my dreamlands are gone<br/>
take my hand and show me that the days of my romance are gone<br/>

woke up with a bassline that i sold to comcast for a dime<br/>
heard them play it back to me online for dollar ninety-nine<br/>
sickness in my chest is back<br/>
sickness in my heart is black<br/>
black is not the sickness its the witness to the sickness<br/>
its the nurse the judge the jury<br/>
but the jury's hung with fury<br/>

last night was mlk<br/>
last night i had a dream<br/>
this morning had a nightmare<br/>
that i was too blind to see<br/>
the sickness in my chest that says i am too old too weak<br/>
the sickness in my mind that says to wake up to defeat<br/>
but who wants to stay woke when i can dream<br/>

put me on repeat<br/>
put me on instagram<br/>
put me inside another box<br/>
to make all my demands<br/>
the voices in my head are back<br/>
voices in my head are black<br/>
saul and james and all the names<br/>
that spilled their ink upon this track<br/>

now i'm flowing mentally<br/>
think environmentally<br/>
penmanship is dying my handwriting aint whats meant to be<br/>
chicken scratch is braver than the ascii that i labor with<br/>
labor is the saviour that has left its marx on all our kids<br/>
kids in gig economies<br/>
kids that like astrology<br/>
kids hope for lobotomies<br/>
these kids that love technology<br/>
im not from the streets i have to lyft to where i gotta be<br/>
Just another box to tick 5 stars upon the profit sheet<br/>
i was once aâ€”i was once a prophet with a scholarship<br/>
twenty days on mescaline if dr king acknowledge it<br/>

last night was mlk<br/>
last night i had a dream<br/>
this morning wokeup got a pen<br/>
to find out what it mean<br/>
open up your mind too far no telling what will take its place<br/>
do whatever you want son just be a credit to your race<br/>
this morning had a nightmare still i dont know what it means<br/>
but who wants to stay woke when i can dream<br/>
