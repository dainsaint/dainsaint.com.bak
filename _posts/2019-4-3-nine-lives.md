**midnight** was three, of course<br/>
he had to be<br/>
a quick black triangle<br/>
darting out the door<br/>
almost as fast as my mother did<br/>
earlier that year<br/>

i didnt blame him<br/>
if my legs could carry me as swiftly<br/>
i would have run just as readily<br/>
just as unprepared<br/>
into a world so quick<br/>
to extinguish excitement<br/>

the police would come<br/>
accusing us as we buried him<br/>
flashlights and guns<br/>
so eager to extinguish my grief<br/>
that i forgot i had any<br/>
left only with a box-shaped hole<br/>

**daybreak** was twenty, of course<br/>
midnight's sister<br/>
crushed over and over by time<br/>
and mistreatment<br/>
and illness<br/>
it was miracle she survived at all<br/>

when she re-entered my care<br/>
and her womb ruptured<br/>
she remained as surprised as i<br/>
that she remained alive<br/>
that having attention paid to her<br/>
was all she needed to stay<br/>

and so through sickness<br/>
and blindness<br/>
and fear<br/>
she held tight to life<br/>
knowing herself lucky<br/>
to have anything to hold at all<br/>

**dusk** was fifteen, of course<br/>
clever, and friendly<br/>
and too sweet, by far<br/>
such that he could not abide<br/>
his own sweetness<br/>
so we managed it for him<br/>

not content to be extinguished<br/>
or to be ignored<br/>
he took up space in a way i envied<br/>
voiced desire in a way i lacked<br/>
gave affection in a way i admired<br/>
made the loudness of his existence known<br/>

he made each of his nine lives felt<br/>
each of his eight miracles<br/>
and went without question<br/>
with no box-shaped hole<br/>
or tightly-held fear to hold him<br/>
slipping away as peacefully as his namesake<br/>

and still,<br/>
we have **dawn**<br/>
