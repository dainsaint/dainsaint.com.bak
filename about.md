Hey there! I've been writing music since my grand-dad sat me in front of a piano when I was, like, ten. In 2008 started [Cipher Prime](https://www.cipherprime.com) with [Will Stallwood](https://willstall.com), and ever since then I've been writing beats and code with reckless abandon. I love using audio, sound effects, and music to make digital experiences truly special.

I like black clothes, but I have white cats.
