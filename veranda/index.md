# A five-week program to get you clear on the next stage of your solo business.
I've been running my own business for over a decade. But in 2018, I was burnt out, struggling, and completely lacking in motivation. I had spent so long going through the motions of running my business that it felt like the business was running me.

So I left.

Mid-project, I took off and went back to stay with my family in Jamaica. I hadn't been back there in over ten years—since before we'd started the company. And I needed something to remind me who I was.

And there, sitting on my grandfather's veranda, I realized the only thing that really mattered was that I was able to get back home, to sit on that veranda with friends and family, laugh over a beer, and just be.

I'd like to help you find your personal veranda.


## The Process
__Veranda__ is business therapy masquerading as productivity coaching.

It's a package of five weekly 1-hour sessions. We'll meet, in-person or via video chat, and walk through the scaffold to really clarify your goals—and reconfigure how you run your business so you can focus on exactly what's important to _you_. The process is a starting point, meaning that while each step is laid out in order for a reason, we are free to deviate from the "script" if there is a more fruitful way to work together.



The sessions are as follows:

__Goal Discovery__: We talk about your current situation and discover what "winning" looks like to you.

__Business Discovery__: We go through your entire business, bottom to top, and discover exactly what it takes to do what you do.

__Systems Design__: We rearrange your business logic into systems that free up your time and focus.

__Time Design__: We rearrange your schedule so you can capitalize on your newfound efficiency.

__Lifestyle Design__: We look at how to use the time you've freed up to reorient towards your new goal.
