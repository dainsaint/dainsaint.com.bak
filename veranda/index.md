description: Five weeks to solo business clarity

# A five-week program to get you clear on the next stage of your solo business.
![Veranda][banner]
I've been running my own business for over a decade. But in 2018, I was burnt out, struggling, and completely lacking in motivation. I had spent so long going through the motions of running my business that it felt like the business was running me.

So I left.

Mid-project, I took off and went back to stay with my family in Jamaica. I hadn't been back there in over ten years—since before we'd started the company. And I needed something to remind me who I was.

And there, sitting on my grandfather's veranda, I realized the only thing that really mattered was that I was able to get back home, to sit on that veranda with friends and family, laugh over a beer, and just be.

I'd like to help you find your personal veranda.


## The Process
__Veranda__ is business therapy disguised as productivity coaching.

It's a package of five weekly 1-hour sessions. We'll meet, in-person or via video chat, and walk through the scaffold to really clarify your goals—and reconfigure how you run your business so you can focus on exactly what's important to _you_. The process is a starting point, meaning that while each step is laid out in order for a reason, we are free to deviate from the "script" if there is a more fruitful way to work together.



The sessions are as follows:

| __Goal Discovery__ | We talk about your current situation and discover what "winning" looks like to you. |
|__Business Discovery__ | We go through your entire business, bottom to top, and discover exactly what it takes to do what you do. |
|__Systems Design__ | We rearrange your business logic into systems that free up your time and focus. |
|__Time Design__ | We rearrange your schedule so you can capitalize on your newfound efficiency. |
|__Lifestyle Design__ | We decide how to use the time you've freed up to reorient towards your new goal. |



## Testimonials
_Nicole F., Developer/Entrepreneur_:
> Dain **helped me get clarity** on an important decision I would have struggled back and forth with for weeks... in 15 minutes.

_Kevin S., Comic Creator_:
> Working with Dain was a phenomenal experience. I sat down with an overloaded brain and a business that...while operating well...was operating in constant reaction mode. I was stressed, burned out, overworked, and feeling resentful of what I created. Within the first session, Dain was able to help me organize and visualize all the processes that make up my business, and then break them all down into their constituent parts so we would build them back up in a way where I could regain my time and autonomy. But Dain did more than just help me regain all that. **Dain helped me remember why I was doing all this in the first place**, creating a mission statement that I couldn't have said better myself. That mission statement has given me purpose and direction that I did not have before. His help and guidance provided me with almost immediate results. And once I gained my time back and was feeling a little more rested, Dain assisted me in learning how to recharge and enjoy the process of creating once more. If you're willing to do the work that Dain lays out for you, then the help he provides in you aligning with the life you want, built from the life you have, is 100% worthwhile.
