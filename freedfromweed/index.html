          We are petitioning the City of Philadelphia to automatically expunge or seal criminal records of those serving sentences for only marijuana-related offenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          By following the example set by municipalties like <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1793" target="_blank">San Francisco</a>, <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/seattle-marijuana-convictions-expunged-6e7d646d3b03/" target="_blank">Seattle</a>, and <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article225243840.html" target="_blank">Kansas City</a>, we can take one small step towards healing communities ravaged by the War on Drugs. This won't make up for the decades of damage and trauma inflicted on minority communities&mdash;<strong>but it's a good start</strong>. </p>

        <h2>Marijuana makes billions for companies while arresting thousands.</h2>
        <p>
          As of today, marijuana is legal in some form in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis_by_U.S._jurisdiction#By_state">32 states</a>, with many more soon to follow.
          Every day, it seems like federal legalization is an inevitable future. And legalization is starting to turn a profit&mdash;literally.
          Legal marijuana was worth an astounding <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/debraborchardt/2017/02/22/marijuana-industry-projected-to-create-more-jobs-than-manufacturing-by-2020/#6e66bb4d3fa9"><strong>$7.6 <em>billion</em></strong></a> in 2016, and it's been growing rapidly every year since.
        </p>

          While this is great for the economy, <em>it&rsquo;s terrible for human decency</em>.

          People who have had their lives turned upside down by marijuana convictions are forced to sit in prison while watching entire new industries pop up to profit from the <em>very activity</em> they were convicted for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, blacks are arrested for marijuana possession a staggering <strong>four times more</strong> than whites, even though usage is <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice/sentencing-reform/war-marijuana-black-and-white">around the same</a>. These convictions strip citizens of voting, housing, employment opportunities. <em>This is a civil rights violation of the highest order</em>, and has been destroying communities for generations.
